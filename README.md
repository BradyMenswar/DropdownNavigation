## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project was my first full page design that I had to implement. I got practice creating custom click events in JS, making mobile layouts, and creating custom components like the dropdowns. All together it was a big step into web design, and I believe that I made a lot of progress when developing.

### Continued development

I think that I would like to learn more about a mobile-first design workflow. This might make my pages easier to manage, as I definitely feel stronger when making the desktop version of pages. I also would like to dive deeper into relative sizing in CSS to get a better handle on responsive web pages.
